Title: Command Entry

Note:

The command entry field is not intended for general purpose
programming or use as a general purpose command-line interface.  It is
primarily intended, instead, to function as a kind of task switcher.

General purpose programming/automation is intended to happen in the
block editor and/or other application(s) the user might want to
activate.

Main Behavior:

1. User types a number of characters.
2. User sees characters as they're typed, from left to right.
3. When user presses ENTER, the line of text entered is interpreted, also from left to right.
4. User sees the OK prompt disappear while interpretation is in progress, and the prompt return when interpretation completes.
5. The current state of the data stack appears on the stack status line.

Exceptional Behavior:

2a. If the typed character would cause the cursor to go beyond the right margin of the command line, then it is ignored.

2b. If the user types the backspace, the last-entered character is removed and the cursor moved correspondingly to the left.  If no further characters remain to be deleted, then the backspace takes no further action.

2c. (OPTIONAL) CTRL-A points the cursor at the beginning of the text entry.  CTRL-E points the cursor at the very end.  CTRL-F moves the cursor forward (right) one character.  CTRL-B moves the cursor back (left) one character without deleting anything.  CTRL-D deletes the currently highlighted character.  CTRL-H is backspace.  CTRL-K disposes of the text starting at the cursor and extending to the current end of the buffer.  CTRL-U disposes of the entire line, regardless of where the cursor is positioned (it's equivalent to CTRL-A CTRL-K).

3. If an unknown command appears in the input stream, then an error is reported to the user and further interpretation halts.

4. If the user asked VDC-Forth to exit back to CP/M, then OK is not printed.
