Title: Application Area

Main Behavior:

1. User types a command that loads and runs an application (e.g., 10 LIST) in the command prompt.
2. The application draws its user interface in the application area.
3. The user finds its focus is in the application area (e.g., for the LIST command, the text cursor resides on line 1 of the block).
4. The user can focus back to the OK prompt via CTRL-Q.  The OK prompt is highlighted, and cursor focuses onto the command line.
5. The user can focus again back to the block editor via CTRL-Q again.  The OK prompt is subdued, and cursor may refocus to the app again.

Exceptional Behavior:

3a. If no application is loaded then using CTRL-Q to focus into the application will be ignored.
3b. If the currently running application desires it, then using CTRL-Q to focus into the application will be ignored.
