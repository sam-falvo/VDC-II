Title: Block File Configuration

Main Behavior:

1. The user can create a new block file (pre-sized for 1800 blocks) using the CREATE command: S" E:DATAFILE.WRT" 1800 CREATE
2. The file can then be mapped into block space starting at block 200 using the MAP command: S" E:DATAFILE.WRT" 200 MAP
3. The user can view the current block file mapping by typing the .MAP command.  The user then sees a table similar to the following:

	...ID  .From  ...To  Mapping
	    0      0     99  C:VIRTMEM.BLK
	    1    200   1999  E:DATAFILE.WRT

4. The user can unmap a block file with the UNMAP command (e.g., 200 UNMAP).  The parameter names any valid block belonging to the file you want to unmap.  The entire range is unmapped.

Exceptional Behavior:

1a. If CP/M reports an error during file allocation, interpretation quits with an error message.

2a. If the specified block file does not exist, interpretation quits with an error message.

2b. If the file would overlap another mapping, interpretation quits with an error message.
